Hi, I’m Soumyadeep Chakravarti 👋

I’m an engineering student at VIT focused on systems programming, low-level tooling, and performance-oriented software. I enjoy building things close to the metal, understanding how systems work end-to-end, and designing clean architectures rather than relying on heavy abstractions.

Most of my work revolves around C, Rust, Linux, terminals, and infrastructure, with side explorations into AI systems and motorsport data.

🚀 About Me

🎓 Engineering student at VIT

🧠 Strong interest in systems programming & internals

🧰 I prefer C / Rust over high-level frameworks unless necessary

🐧 Daily driver: Arch Linux

🧪 I like rebuilding things from scratch to understand them properly

⚡ Motorsport + tech nerd — interested in vehicle dynamics, telemetry, and simulation

🛠️ What I Actually Work On

Systems & Low-Level

C-based TUI framework
Building a terminal UI library from scratch (Screen → Window → Component), inspired by tools like btop, with a clean architecture and zero heavy dependencies.

CLI & terminal tooling
Experimenting with shells, editors, and reusable CLI abstractions in C.


Personal Assistant / AI Systems

Jarvis (from scratch)
A personal assistant rewritten multiple times with a focus on:

Low-level implementation (C first, Python only when unavoidable)

Clean module boundaries

Direct integration with llama.cpp via the C API


Exploring local LLM inference, memory systems, and efficient model serving without bloated stacks.


Infrastructure & Linux

Homelab & self-hosting

Docker, reverse proxies, service isolation

Music servers, file browsers, monitoring tools


Strong interest in Linux internals, process models, and networking basics


Simulation & Motorsport

Experimenting with vehicle setup simulation, telemetry concepts, and engine behavior modeling (for sims, not real engines).

Focused more on setup logic & data than graphics or tracks.

📂 Notable Projects

Jarvis — Personal assistant built with a low-level, modular mindset

C TUI Framework — Component-based terminal UI system in pure C

ObservableHorizon — NASA Horizons data parser & storage tool

Homelab Infrastructure — Self-hosted services, Dockerized and maintained manually


(Several projects are intentionally experimental or rewritten often — learning > polish.)
